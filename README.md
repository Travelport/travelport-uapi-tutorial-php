PHP Tutorial to Consume UAPI for Air Search, Hotel Search/Detail/Book, Vehicle Search

PHP travelport-uapi-tutorial-php
========================

This PHP tutorial provides the building blocks for coding a flight, hotel, and vehicle booking application in [Travelport Universal API](http://developer.travelport.com/app/developer-network/universal-api). It teaches you how to setup and configure Travelport Universal API and how to send basic requests. You will learn how to:
<ul>
<li>Request Air schedules, availability, and pricing, and book flights.</li>
<li>Request Hotel and Vehicle availability and pricing, request vehicle types, and book a hotel and vehicle.</li>
</ul>

You can read the [tutorial online via Github](http://travelport.github.com/travelport-uapi-tutorial/) or you can clone the repository and examine the branch 'gh-pages'.

If you have questions or comments, please post them to the [issue tracker in Github](https://github.com/Travelport/travelport-uapi-tutorial/issues).

If you are experienced with WSDL and C#, we would love to see a port of this code to C# for those more familiar with Windows development. You can submit this port to us with a pull request.
